	<h1>Prior Work Experience</h1>
	<p>So far, I have worked at two different jobs. My first job was recommended to me by my computer science teacher, and was as a Student Tech Lead with the Nelson County School District. That job, which I started in the summer of 2020, lasted until May of 2021, when I graduated from high school. My next job was with a company called Quality Service Installations (QSI for short) as a RMC Engineer. That job began in June of 2021, and lasted until September of 2021, when I decided to focus more on my education.</p>
